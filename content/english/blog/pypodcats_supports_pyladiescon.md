[PyLadiesCon](https://conference.pyladies.com) is back, stronger than ever for its second year, and PyPodcats is thrilled to be their official media partner! As the media partner, we are sharing our podcast-creation resources, like [StreamYard and Veed.io subscriptions](/about/financials), with PyLadiesCon and PyLadiesCon speakers.

At PyPodcats, we've always advocated for the underrepresented Pythonistas in our community, and we're proud to support PyLadiesCon in 2024.

## What is PyLadiesCon?

(PyLadiesCon)(https://conference.pyladies.com/) is the global conference for the [PyLadies](https://pyladies.com) community, and it is **the place to be** this December! It’s all happening online from December 6-8, 2024, and the best part? It’s FREE. This event is all about empowering PyLadies, spreading knowledge, and embracing diversity in the Python world.

### Multilingual Talks and Sessions

One of the coolest things about PyLadiesCon is that the speakers get to present in whichever language they’re most comfortable with. Yep, it’s a fully multilingual event—no need to stress over language barriers here! So attendees will be also able to watch the talks with captioning if the talk is not delivered in the language the attendee preferred.

### What to Expect at PyLadiesCon

Here’s a quick outline:
##### Talks
Expect tons of insightful talks covering everything, from the latest Python trends to the best practices, and cutting-edge tech from our inspiring speakers.
