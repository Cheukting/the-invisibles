The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect,
and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the
growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers.

Our community is based on mutual respect, tolerance, and encouragement,
and we are working to help each other live up to these principles.

There are many other podcast series in the Python community. However,
our team felt that the existing Python podcasts did not focus on the diverse
Python community members. In many cases, women and underrepresented group members
were rarely invited as the podcast speaker.

We know that there are in fact many underrepresented members in our community that are
doing great work out there, who have inspired us with their stories, and who deserve
to be seen and heard. By creating
this podcast series, we hope for the rest of the Python community to also be inspired
by them.
